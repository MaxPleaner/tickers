- I was reading about Teletext for the first time and I kind of liked the aesthetic of the Teletext interface.

- I found the [telestrap](http://code.steadman.io/telestrap/) bootstrap theme which I think is super cool.

- I needed an excuse to make something with this and so started reading about Teletext on wikipedia for inspiration.

- My reading led me to telegraphs, "ticker tape parades",
  and how historical "stock tickers" have transformed into high-speed trading. 

- I decided to make a site which shows the live-updating output of commands being run on an interval.

- It'd been a while since I used Bootstrap so I started by making a little "cheat sheet" for basic usage of
  the Telestrap theme
